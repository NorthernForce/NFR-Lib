# Team 172 (Northern Force) First Robotics Competition Library

This library is meant to provide utility classes and methods that are used year after year by Team 172. Additionally, it serves the purpose of keeping the flow and layout of the code consistent for years to come, ensuring smooth transitions each year and ensuring our team's sustainability.

## Layout

The library is to be located in `insert package name here`. Various subpackages should exist containing classes relevant to only a specific part or subsystem of the robot.
